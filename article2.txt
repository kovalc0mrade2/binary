#Being A Responsible Developer

Last night, I was listening to the combined DevHell and PHPTownHall Mashup podcast 
recording, listening to them discuss a topic I talked about in my last blog post. 
While they definitely understood my points, they for the most part disagreed with 
me (there was some contention in the discussion though). I don't mind that they 
disagreed, but I was rather taken aback by their justification. Let me explain...

##The Rationale

The general consensus was that as an ideology, only supporting latest versions is 
correct. From a practical standpoint though they said that it's unrealistic. That 
there are tons of legacy systems out there that are running just fine and can't 
justify the cost of upgrading. So they shouldn't have to upgrade "for ideological 
reasons".

From one point of view, this certainly makes sense. It can be expensive to maintain 
software, especially old and outdated software. If it's running, why not just let 
it run? After all, if you don't have problems with it, why bother touching it (if 
it ain't broke, don't fix it).

This point of view disturbs me deeply. And it further disturbs me that it came 
from the same person who preaches for testing.
