Alternatives To MVC
Last week, I wrote A Beginner's Guide To MVC For The Web. In it, I described some of the problems with both the MVC pattern and the conceptual "MVC" that frameworks use. But what I didn't do is describe better ways. I didn't describe any of the alternatives. So let's do that. Let's talk about some of the alternatives to MVC...

Problems With MVC
Let's restate the fundamental problems we talked about that exist with MVC:

MVC Is Stateful

It only makes sense if the View, as well as the View-Model binding is stateful (so the Model can update the View when it changes)

MVC Has No Single Interpretation

Every framework uses their own nuanced version.

Where does application code that's not clearly data-centric belong in the application?
